The Watchlist is your personal dashboard for upcoming programs. It integrates directly with the Electronic Program Guide (EPG) to provide timely notifications and automated channel switching.

## Managing Your Watchlist

### Adding Programs
To track a show, open the **Guide (G)**, find the upcoming program, and select **Add to Watchlist** from the right-click context menu.

### Reminder Settings
When adding a program, you can customize how ynoTV handles the start time:
- **Notification Lead Time**: Set a reminder to trigger a specific number of minutes before the program begins.
- **Auto-Switch**: Enable this option to have ynoTV automatically tune into the correct channel as soon as the program starts.

<Aside type="note">
Watchlist notifications appear as a non-intrusive overlay and will automatically dismiss after 10 seconds if no action is taken.

## Interactive Notifications

When a Watchlist reminder triggers:
1. **Visual Alert**: A notification pops up with the program title and channel.
2. **Quick Action**: Click the notification to immediately switch to that channel.
3. **Smart Handling**: If **Auto-Switch** is enabled, the player will transition to the new stream without requiring manual confirmation.
