Multiview allows you to monitor up to four streams at once, perfect for tracking multiple games or news cycles simultaneously.

## Layout Modes

ynoTV supports four distinct viewing modes:
1. **Main View**: Standard single-channel playback.
2. **Picture-in-Picture**: A large primary screen with a small secondary overlay.
3. **Big + Bottom Bar**: A large main view with a horizontal bar for rapid secondary channel access.
4. **2x2 Grid**: Four equal-sized screens for balanced monitoring.

## Using Multiview

### Adding Channels
1. Switch to a Multiview layout (Modes 2, 3, or 4).
2. Navigate the **Live TV** or **EPG** lists.
3. Right-click a channel and select **Send to Slot #** (e.g., Send to Slot 2).

### Interaction & Controls
- **Swap Screens**: Click on any secondary screen to instantly swap its stream with the main primary window.
- **Audio Control**: Each screen can be independently muted or unmuted.
- **Seamless Switching**: If you return to Main View and then back to a Multiview grid, ynoTV will resume playback of your previously viewed channels in their respective slots.

## Persistence & Startup

In **Settings** > **Startup**, you can enable advanced persistence:
- **Remember Last Viewed**: Automatically saves the stream playing in each screen.
- **Reopen Last on Startup**: If enabled, ynoTV will launch directly into your last used Multiview layout and autoplay all saved streams.
