ynoTV's search engine is designed for speed, allowing you to filter through thousands of channels and Electronic Program Guide (EPG) entries in milliseconds.

## Search Mechanics

### Quick Access
Press the default search key **(S)** to instantly focus the search input in the title bar.

### Scope of Search
ynoTV indexes the following data for real-time results:
- **Channel Names**: Matches against all active provider channel lists.
- **EPG Data**: Scans current and upcoming program titles and descriptions.

### Visibility Filters
Your global search results respect your privacy and organization settings. Any sources, categories, or individual channels that you have **disabled** in Settings will not appear in search results.

<Aside type="tip">
Search is case-insensitive and supports partial matching, allowing you to find "BBC One" simply by typing "bbc".
