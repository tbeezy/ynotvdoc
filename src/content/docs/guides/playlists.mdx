ynoTV offers powerful tools to organize thousands of channels into manageable, personalized collections. Use Custom Groups to curate your viewing experience without affecting the original source structure.

## Custom Groups

Custom Groups allow you to bridge channels from different providers into a single, unified list.

### Creating a Custom Group
1. **Initialize**: In the sidebar, click the **+ icon** next to the "Categories" header.
2. **Name**: Enter a descriptive name for your new group and save.
3. **Populate**:
   - Right-click your new group and select **Manage**.
   - **Search & Add**: Use the search bar to find specific channels or manually browse the provider tree directory.
   - **One-Click Add**: While browsing the Electronic Program Guide (EPG), simply right-click any channel and select **Add to Custom Group**.

<Aside type="tip">
Custom Groups are ideal for creating "Favorites" lists that aggregate content from multiple M3U or Xtream providers.

## Playlist Management

Fine-tune your library with granular controls located in **Settings** > **Manage Playlists**.

### Category & Channel Control
- **Sort Order**: Click **Categories** on any source card to reorder them via drag-and-drop.
- **Visibility**: Toggle the visibility of entire categories or individual channels to declutter your interface.
- **Granular Editing**: Within the **Manage Categories** view, you can reorder channels or remove them entirely from the view.
- **EPG Management**: Access **Manage Channels** directly from the EPG view of any category to quickly prune your guide.

### Automated Cleanup
Use **Filter Words** to maintain a clean interface. For example, setting a filter for "US | " will automatically strip that prefix from any channel name starting with it, making your guide much easier to read at a glance.
