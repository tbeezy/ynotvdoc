## Professional Management

### Advanced Configuration
For advanced users, each source card offers deep customization:
- **Priority Order**: Drag and drop sources in the Settings page to define their global sort order.
- **Connection Failover**: Add backup credentials to ensure uninterrupted service if a primary MAC address or account is flagged.
- **Diagnostic Tools**: View real-time metadata including connection limits and provider-side expiration dates.

### Playlist Refinement
Beyond adding sources, you can refine how content is presented:
- **Filtering**: Apply filter words (e.g., "US") to strip repetitive prefixes from channel names automatically.
- **Direct Editing**: Right-click any source in the **Live TV** view to quickly jump to provider settings or category management.
- **Global Sync**: Use the **Refresh** icon to manually reload data, ensuring your guide is always up-to-date with the latest provider changes.
