ynoTV includes a high-performance Digital Video Recorder (DVR) system, allowing you to archive live streams for later viewing without quality loss.

<Aside type="caution">
DVR functionality requires **FFmpeg** to be installed on your system. ynoTV will attempt to auto-detect your local FFmpeg installation on startup.

## Recording Management

Access the **DVR Dashboard** (Key: `R`) to view active, scheduled, and completed recordings.

### Start/End Padding
To ensure you never miss the beginning or end of a program (common in live sports), you can adjust "Padding" for any scheduled recording:
- **Start Padding**: Extra time recorded before the official start.
- **End Padding**: Extra time recorded after the official end.

These can be adjusted globally in **Settings** or on a per-recording basis via the **DVR Page**.

### Active Controls
While a recording is in progress, you can monitor its status via the dashboard or stop it manually at any time. Completed files are stored in your configured recording path and can be played directly through the ynoTV interface.
