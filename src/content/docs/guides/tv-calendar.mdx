The TV Calendar is a powerful tool for television enthusiasts, allowing you to track specific series across different channels and providers.

## Tracking Shows

### Adding a Show
1. Open the **Electronic Program Guide (EPG)**.
2. Locate a show you wish to follow.
3. Right-click the program and select **Add to Calendar**.

Once added, the show will appear in the **My Shows** section. ynoTV will save the channel where you discovered the show as its default broadcast source.

### Customizing the Source
If a show is available on multiple channels, you can change the default source:
1. Navigate to **My Shows**.
2. Select the specific show.
3. Change the assigned channel to your preferred source.

## Automated Episode Tracking

From the **My Shows** dashboard, you can enable advanced automation:
- **Auto-add to Watchlist**: Enable this option to automatically add all newly discovered episodes to your Watchlist upon every data sync.
- **Automated Reminders**: Set global defaults for notifications or auto-switching for your tracked series.
