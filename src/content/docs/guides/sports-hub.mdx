The Sports Hub is a dedicated dashboard for sports enthusiasts, aggregating live scores, upcoming schedules, and league-specific data from ESPN.

## Personalized Experience

### Favorite Teams
You can follow specific teams to have them appear prominently in the **Teams** tab:
1. Navigate to the **Leagues** section.
2. Select your league and find your team.
3. Mark them as a favorite to track their progress throughout the season.

### Hub Settings
Access the **Settings** gear within the Sports Hub to customize your view:
- **Display Preferences**: Toggle which leagues and stats are shown.
- **Auto-Update**: The "Live Now" page automatically refreshes every 30 seconds during active games to ensure scores are always current.

## Viewing Features

### In-Page Streaming
Click the **Stream Icon** next to the Sports Hub header to pin your current live stream directly onto the sports dashboard. This allows you to track scores across multiple leagues while never losing sight of the action—similar to the EPG view.

### Live Coverage
The **Live Now** tab provides a real-time overview of all ongoing games across supported leagues. If a game is currently being broadcast by one of your providers, you can often jump directly to that channel from the scoreboard.
